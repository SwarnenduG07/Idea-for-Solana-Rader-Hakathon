# Idea for Solana Rader Hakathon

## Building a decentralized Social media with voting on each post

## So the Idea is I want to build a decentralized social media where user’s can hide there identity and they can post anything they want. Like in Something they are afraid of posting by there name. then Can post anonymously and other user’s can vote up/down  that post. For this the most voted tweets will be on the 1st list of the page on descending order and all use’s can see this. For being decentralized There is no fear of any central/political/thirdparty pressure. Everyone can post anonymously their thoughts and there is no fear for posting.

### KEY POINTS ⇒ 

1. Decentralized
2. Anonymity
3. Voting system
4. voting system on each post
5. Freedom of Speech
